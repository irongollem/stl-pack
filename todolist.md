# Todo List

## To Do

- [ ] Update the models field on the metadata json when adding a file
- [ ] Have the group field auto-suggest from groups already in the release
- [ ] ARCHITECTURE: Currently we are only storing the paths in the json, but in doing so also reduce the info available in the UI. The data in the UI should be complete. From creation dont throw away the data too soon and when revisiting compose the UI info from the json PLUS the underlying jsons.
- [ ] Replace finalize call release dir. Now uses the one written in the JSON which isnt correct (check that too)

## Done

- [x] FIX Dir not created
- [x] Replace fileinput with tauri dialogs
- [x] BUG: fileSelect shouldnt overwrite but add
- [x] Stop enter from instantly posting model
- [x] Inside the release should come the models, they shouldnt be in a "models" subdirectory first
- [x] Storage images and files releated to create release as well
- [x] Add STL-Pack logo instead of tauri logo to the taskbar
- [x] Clear filelist after save model is complete
- [x] BUG: Saving model triggers: _"Failed to save model: Error: Release directory name is missing"_
- [x] Let users edit premade models when selecting them in the release tab
- [x] Fix the finalize action, now throws a "Failed to finalize release: [object Object]
- [x] BUG: make sure tab navigation works and respects disabled tabs
- [x] Make sure the release remains in the release tab
- [x] Add uuid to models (and releases) to find them back once they move or to "symlink" them in case a model is part of multiple releases
